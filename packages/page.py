Animal Classification with ResNet18

Welcome to the Animal Classification project, where we harness the power of deep learning to identify and categorize animals using ResNet18! In this section, we dive into how ResNet18, a deep convolutional neural network, is employed to classify various animal species with impressive accuracy.

ResNet18, short for Residual Network with 18 layers, is renowned for its ability to handle complex image recognition tasks. Its innovative architecture includes residual blocks that help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the model to learn intricate patterns and features from animal images effectively.

In this project, we leverage ResNet18’s capabilities to develop a robust animal classification system. We’ll explore how the model processes images, learns from diverse datasets, and makes predictions. By the end, you’ll gain insights into both the technical aspects of ResNet18 and its practical applications in animal recognition.

Join us as we unravel the magic behind animal classification with ResNet18 and see how deep learning transforms image analysis.
