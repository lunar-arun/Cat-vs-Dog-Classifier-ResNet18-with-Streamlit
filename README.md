### Cat vs Dog Classification using ResNet18 with streamlit

This project implements an animal classification system using ResNet18, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture. ResNet18â€™s deep residual learning framework allows it to accurately classify images of various animal species by learning from extensive datasets. This repository includes the code and resources needed to train and evaluate the model, along with instructions for using it to identify animals from images. Explore how deep learning techniques can be applied to solve complex image classification problems and enhance your understanding of modern AI capabilities.

# Instructions to Edit and Run the App Locally
